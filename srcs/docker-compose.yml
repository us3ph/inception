#     services:
#     mariadb:
#       container_name: mariadb
#       build:
#         context: ./requirements/mariadb
#         dockerfile: Dockerfile
#
#   services: - List of containers to create
#   mariadb: - Name of the service (used for DNS)
#   container_name: - Actual container name in Docker
#   build: - Build from our Dockerfi
#     dockerfile: - Which file to use (usually just "Dockerfile")




#   wordpress:le
#     context: - Where to find the Dockerfile
#     depends_on:
#       - mariadb
#
#   nginx:
#     depends_on:
#       - wordpress
#   ```
#
#   **This creates a startup order:**
#   ```
#   1. Start mariadb first
#      ↓
#   2. Then start wordpress (waits for mariadb)
#      ↓
#   3. Then start nginx (waits for wordpress)

#Important: depends_on only waits for the container to start, not to be ready. That's why we have the until mariadb loop in our WordPress setup script!






#  volumes:
#    mariadb_data:
#      driver: local
#      driver_opts:
#        type: none
#        o: bind
#        device: /home/${USER}/data/mariadb
#  ```
#
#  **Visual explanation:**
#  ```
#  Your Computer                  Container
#  /home/user/data/mariadb   ←→   /var/lib/mysql
#       (Host)                    (Container)
#  ```
#
#  **Why do we need this?**
#
#  Without volumes:
#  ```
#  1. Container creates database files
#  2. You stop the container
#  3. You start it again
#  4. Database is empty! ❌ (data lost)
#  ```
#
#  With volumes:
#  ```
#  1. Container creates database files → saved to host
#  2. You stop the container
#  3. You start it again
#  4. Database is still there! ✅ (data persists)





#   networks:
#     inception:
#       driver: bridge
#   ```
#
#   Networks let containers talk to each other:
#
#   **Without a network:**
#   ```
#   MariaDB: "I'm at 172.17.0.2"
#   WordPress: "Where are you? I can't find you!" ❌
#   ```
#
#   **With a network:**
#   ```
#   MariaDB: "I'm on the 'inception' network"
#   WordPress: "Hey mariadb, are you there?"
#   MariaDB: "Yes! Here's your data!" ✅

#   Docker creates DNS automatically:
#
#   Container name = hostname
#   mariadb → resolves to MariaDB container's IP
#   wordpress → resolves to WordPress container's IP
#
#   Bridge driver:
#
#   Creates an isolated network
#   Containers can talk to each other
#   Containers can reach the internet
#   Host can't access containers (except through exposed ports)







#   secrets:
#     db_password:
#       file: ../secrets/db_password.txt
#   ```
#
#   Secrets are **secure way to pass sensitive data** to containers.
#
#   **How it works:**
#   ```
#   1. Docker reads ../secrets/db_password.txt
#   2. Mounts it to /run/secrets/db_password in the container
#   3. Your script reads: cat /run/secrets/db_password
#   4. File is only readable by the container (secure!)

#Why not just use environment variables?

#  Environment variables:
#  docker inspect wordpress
#  # Shows: MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword123
#  # ❌ Anyone can see it!
#
#  Secrets:
#  docker inspect wordpress
#  # Shows: /run/secrets/db_password
#  # ✅ File path, not the actual password!




#  nginx:
#    ports:
#      - "443:443"
#  ```
#
#  **This means:**
#  ```
#  Host port 443  →  Container port 443
#      ↓                    ↓
#  Your computer        Nginx container
#  ```
#
#  **Visual explanation:**
#  ```
#  Internet
#     ↓
#  Your Computer (port 443)
#     ↓
#  Docker forwards to → Nginx container (port 443)
#     ↓
#  Nginx handles the request
